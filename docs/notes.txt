AFTER PHASE 3:
    - refactor initialization Kiwi, structure more flat, each module factory return module container, with required
      objects initialized and pass container to next factory (can be decorator or chain)
    - refactor observability module, instead of direct implementation of each possible metrics class,
      implement container with several maps (counter, gauge, etc) which holds metrics by name.
      For adding metrics just call method "onAction(String metric name)" on one singleton instance of metrics
